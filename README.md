# Convolutional-Neural-Network
In this project, I trained the Convolutional Neural Netwrok (CNN) algorithm by adapting 8000 images of cats and dogs (4000 photos for each group) and tested the accuracy of this machine by applying extra 2000 images in order to perfectly distinguish given cat and dog images from eachother. Finally I completed my model to be capable of recognizing whether it is cat or dog by introducing a single image to the fully-trained CNN model.
